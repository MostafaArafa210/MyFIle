 I'd be happy to help you write a report for the information disclosure vulnerability you've discovered on the web application www.exam.com.

**Vulnerability Report: Information Disclosure on https://version.hylatest.com**

**Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure
**Vulnerability Location:** www.exam.com
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:**

During a security assessment of the web application www.exam.com, I discovered an information disclosure vulnerability that exposes sensitive system information. The vulnerability is caused by the exposure of a configuration file that contains details about the system's architecture, operating system, and file system layout.

**Vulnerability Details:**

The vulnerable endpoint returns the following response:

```
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
source: /
destination: /var/www/html/
hooks:
  ApplicationStop:
    location: scripts/appstop.sh
    timeout: 6000
    runas: ubuntu
  BeforeInstall:
    location: scripts/beforeinstall.sh
    timeout: 300
    runas: ubuntu
  AfterInstall:
    location: scripts/afterinstall.sh
    timeout: 6000
```

This response reveals the following sensitive information:

* The operating system used by the server is Linux.
* The file system layout, including the source and destination directories.
* The existence of scripts and their locations, including `appstop.sh`, `beforeinstall.sh`, and `afterinstall.sh`.
* The user account used to run these scripts, which is `ubuntu`.
* The timeout values for each script.

**Impact:**

This information disclosure vulnerability can have significant implications for the security of the web application. An attacker can use this information to:

* Identify potential vulnerabilities in the Linux operating system or related software.
* Map the file system layout to identify potential entry points for attacks.
* Analyze the scripts and their functionality to identify potential weaknesses or backdoors.
* Use the revealed user account information to launch targeted attacks, such as password guessing or privilege escalation.

**Recommendations:**

To remediate this vulnerability, I recommend the following:

* Restrict access to the configuration file to prevent unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
* Implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the file.
* Review the scripts and their functionality to ensure they are secure and do not introduce additional vulnerabilities.
* Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent similar information disclosure vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

The information disclosure vulnerability on www.exam.com poses a significant risk to the security of the web application. I strongly recommend that the development team takes immediate action to remediate this vulnerability and implement additional security measures to prevent similar disclosures in the future.
