                "What is identity theft? How can I protect myself from identity theft?",
              "answer" : "Identity theft is a serious crime where your personal information — anything from your name, driver’s license or Social Security Number — has been hijacked by an imposter to commit fraud in your name. You’re the first line of defense when it comes to protecting your identity. Check your credit reports and financial accounts regularly for any suspicious activity. You can get your credit report [here](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action) for free weekly from all three credit reporting agencies. Set up transaction alerts if your bank offers them to notify you of all account activity. Finally, consider adding a [fraud alert](/fraud-alerts) or [credit freeze](/credit-freeze).

It includes credit inquiries, open and closed credit accounts, your payment history and bankruptcies (if applicable). It also contains personal information such as your current and former address(es), names and employers. All this information is part of your data identity. By managing it regularly, you can help ensure you’re accurately represented in the modern economy so you can get the credit opportunities you desire."

                "A data breach occurs when someone’s personal information is stolen or exposed without their permission. If you are a victim of a data breach, consider the following steps:  <br>" +
                "<ul>" +
                "<li>Alert your credit card companies immediately and all financial institutions; the bank can freeze your accounts and help prevent them from being drained.</li>" +

                "<li>Monitor financial and online accounts for suspicious activity. Your email or social media accounts, for example, may have also been compromised.</li>" +

            {
              "question" : "What is a credit freeze?",
              "answer" : "A credit freeze, also known as a security freeze, can be added to your TransUnion credit file to prevent all third parties, such as credit lenders or other companies, whose use is not exempt under law, from accessing your credit file without your consent. <br><br>Remember, if you have a freeze you must remove or temporarily lift it to apply for credit. You can add, temporarily lift and remove freezes online through the [TransUnion Service Center](https://service.transunion.com/dss/login.page?dest=freezeStatus). It’s free to add, temporarily lift and remove a freeze."

              "answer" : "A fraud alert is a statement that is added to your credit file that will notify potential credit grantors that you may be or have been a victim of identity theft. Before they extend credit, they should use reasonable procedures to verify your identity. Fraud alerts are free to add and are valid for one year."

            {
              "question" : "Why would I need a credit freeze or fraud alert?",
              "answer" :
                "These powerful tools can help you steer clear of identity theft or prevent history from repeating itself if you’ve already fallen victim. They offer added protection, making it more difficult for anyone, including fraudsters, to apply for credit using your info.<br>" +
                "<br>" +
                "Think of a freeze or fraud alert like a fortress for your personal data. They strengthen your defense but aren’t impenetrable, so it’s still important to regularly monitor your credit."

A credit freeze blocks access to your credit report if anyone tries to open a new account. For more information about the difference between fraud alerts and credit freezes, check out our [blog](/blog/identity-protection/difference-between-a-fraud-alert-and-credit-freeze)."

              "answer" : "Adding, lifting or removing a freeze online often happens in real time, but to be on the safe side, allow up to one hour for it to go into effect. If you add, lift or remove a freeze by phone or mail, this may take up to 3 business days from the date the request is received."
            },
            {
              "question" : "What is the difference between a credit freeze and a credit lock?",
              "answer" : "A credit freeze is free and prevents lenders from checking your credit in order to open a new account. It is a great way to control who can access your credit. A credit lock is a feature available to you through TransUnion Credit Monitoring, a paid subscription product. It lets you lock your TransUnion and Equifax credit reports and includes alerts and additional features."

              "question" : "Do credit freezes freeze my credit card so I can't buy things with it?",
              "answer" : "No. A credit freeze doesn’t affect your credit card. You credit report won’t be accessible, but that won’t affect your credit card. They are two different things."
